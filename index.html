        My name is Brittany Files and I am a 26 year old female from just outside of southeastern Philadelphia. I love the city, and have spent a lot of my time growing up here. I have lived all
        over the East Coast, but I always find my way back home! I originally went to college in Boston, Massachusetts after graduating high school, and studied English literature. After spending many years studying literature and communications,
        I realized that my passion was no longer with writing, which was my plan for a career at the time. I spent some time in my early adulthood grappling with what to do next, and it was around that time that I had my daughter, Lennon. <br />
        That was two years ago, and after spending all of the last two years focused on raising my daughter, I have now reached a point where I have the time available to really focus on what is going to come next for me. When I began to discover
        coding careers and possibilities, I wasn't completely unfamiliar with it. I spent a lot of my teenage years doing basic HTML coding on things like MySpace, some of my adulthood in administration learning to edit some more complicated codes,
        and it has always been something I enjoyed. I find created code and debugging code to be a lot of fun. Spending hours on a code and having it run beautifully is extremely satistfying for me, and I am so glad that I found a coding bootcamp
        to help me explore my potentional and the possiblities that I have in front of my in this career! </p>
