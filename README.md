# My Portfolio


## Overview
    For this assignment I was tasked with creating a dynamic and responsive portfolio page. The requirements for the assignment were to create three separate pages to show some information about me, my coding works, and a place to submit a form to contact me. In order to accomplish this, I have to had a working navigation bar to get to these pages as well.
    
    In order to make my project work effectively, I created three separate HTML files, one CSS file, and then I utilized pre-coded CSS from Bootstrap as well. In these three HTML files, I included all of the content that is visible on all three of my pages. In my CSS file, I included all of the styling preferences I had that were not already classified in Bootstrap. 

    In addition to the aforementioned requirements, I also added some additionals attributes that make my page more representative of my own personal style. I used a dark layout and added in my own background image. I removed the coloring behind the footer to create a contract for my icons, which are working links to various different ways to explore more information about myself. I also created a fourth HTML page at the last minute, and linked it with a button on my contact page. Now, the contact page's form is working and can actually be utilized, while taking the user to a new page and letting them know their contact request has been submitted!
